1. Objects:
    EVERYTHING IN PYTHON IS AN OBJECT AND HAS A TYPE
    - Every object has:
        type
        data representation - primitive or composite
        set of procedures for interaction

    - Each instance is a particular type of object
        1 2 3 4 is an instance of an int
        a = "hello", a is an instance of a string

    - Each object is an data abstraction
        internal representation through data attributes
        interface fpr interacting with object through methods (procedure), defines behaviors but hides implementation
    
    - Can create enw instances of objects;
    
    - Can destroy objects;
        explicitly using del or just let the garbage collector remove it
        Python system will reclaim destroyed or inaccessible objects;

2. Creating And Using Your Own Objects With Clases:
    - creating a class != using and instance of the class

    - Creating:
        defining the class name;
        defining the attributes;

    - Using the class:
        creating new instance of objects;
        doing operations on the instances

3. Advantages of OOP:
    - Bundle data into packages toghether with procedures that work on them through well-defined interfaces -> Abstraction
    - dived-and-conquer:
        implement and test behavior of each class separately
        increased modularity reduces complexity

    - classes make it easy to reuse code:
        many Python modules define new classes
        each class has a separate environment (no collision on function names)
        inheritance allows subclasses to redefine or extend a selected subset of a superclass' nehavior
